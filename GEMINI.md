This is a pdf reader project with read aloud feature.

## Getting Started
- It is a vite react with ts+swc setup.
- Use pnpm only
- Don't run server (pnpm dev), it is already running on port 5173, in a different terminal.
- We will use tailwind v4 (which has a lot different syntax for config than v3) [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite)

## Tailwind -
- Using utitlity classes is fine, but don't create any config file, it won't work.
